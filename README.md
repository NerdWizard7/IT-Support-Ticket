# IT-Support-Ticket
IT Support Ticket System

This software was originally developed for Benefit Management, Inc. in Joplin, MO, by Caleb. A. Smith.
The software is licensed under the FreeBSD license. See License.txt for more information.

This software provides a way for employees in an office environment to submit custom support tickets to an IT department. Some of the code in this repository is left over from BMI, and will need to be modified in order to fit other business needs.

I have tried to indicate where these changes would need to be made in the code.



A database is required for this software to function, and keeps track of requests and administration notes. MySQL was used originally, although the code could be adapted to other database needs.
