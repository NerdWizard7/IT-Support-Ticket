# IT-Support-Ticket
IT Support Ticket System

This software was originally developed for a small medical insurance company by Caleb. A. Smith.
The software is licensed under the FreeBSD license. See License.txt for more information.

This software provides a way for employees in an office environment to submit custom support tickets to an IT department.


A database is required for this software to function, and keeps track of requests and administration notes. MySQL was used originally, although the code could be adapted to other database needs.
